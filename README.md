# Machine-Learning-Codes-from-Scratch

* This repository contains codes I have implemented during my Machine Learning course CS6140
* It contains different implementations of the following ML algorithms from scratch.
* Raise issues or email me for any doubts
* email id: badugu.n@husky.neu.edu

# Running the code:
* All the algorithms are implemented in python 3.6
* numpy, scipy and matplotlib are the only dependencies
